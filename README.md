# ðŸ¦¾ Exoskeleton UI - Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Interface ðŸ¦¾

This project is a graphical menu system created with **Python** and **Kivy** and designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi 4**, with a 7" touchscreen.

This project is designed for real-time mode switching, configuration and intuitive control

## Features

- Full-screen 800x480 UI with touch and physical buttons
- Operational mode for visual feedback
- Buzzer-based feedback system
- Clean hardware-software integration

## Setup Instructions

### 1.  Setup Raspberry Pi
#### Needed Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Official 7" Raspberry Pi Touschreen display
- 4 jumper cables (female to female)
- DSI ribbon cable 
- Official power supply highly recommended (5V 3A)
- Screwdriver
- Antistatic towel

#### Physical Connection
You can follow the steps in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIUfAIiSzJA&ab_channel=MakeUseOf)
- Place your towel on your working table, then the touchscreen display facing down
- Insert the four power wires, and the DSI ribbon cable (blue side down). Ensure it is securely locked with the catch. It should look as it is shown in the following image:

The following colors are used:
*black* for GND
*yellow* for SCL
*green* for SDA
*red* for 5V

- Mount the raspberry on top of the touchscreen, make sure the screw holes are correcly aligned.
